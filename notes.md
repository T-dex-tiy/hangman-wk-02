Stuck on conecting the letter guessing to the game.
I have added a input and text box just to get something on the page.

Struggled with grabbing the data from the input field on to the app to change the DOM. After playing with eventlister and query selector Managed to get code to work.


Added Alpahbet visual to HTML thru Javascript with // let alphabetNode = document.querySelector("div#alphabet")
alphabetNode.textContent = alphabet.join(" ");
